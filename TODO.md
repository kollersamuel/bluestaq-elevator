- Minor bug: If a person is going down to floor 7 from floor 10 and floor 1 is prioritized, floor 7 stays in down queue, so after reaching floor 1, the elevator goes up to floor 8, then back down to floor 7.
    - To fix, if stop added to priority queue, clear other queues. Then when priority queue is empty, requeue everything.
